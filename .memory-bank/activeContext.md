# LSF Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The LSF project is currently in active development with the following focus areas:

1. **Enhance Documentation and Examples**:
   - Add more comprehensive usage examples
   - Create integration examples with LLM frameworks
   - Complete API reference documentation with TypeDoc

2. **Package Publication**:
   - Publish NPM and PyPI packages
   - Update documentation with installation instructions
   - Create release notes

3. **C# Implementation**:
   - Start developing C# version based on existing patterns
   - Ensure consistent API across all language implementations
   - Implement full test suite for C# version

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add benchmarking tools and methodology
   - Compare performance to JSON alternatives
   - Optimize parsing and serialization performance

## Recent Changes

1. **Memory Bank Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive Memory Bank structure
   - Documented project requirements, context, and progress

2. **Python Implementation**:
   - Completed full implementation of encoder, decoder, and simple API
   - Added comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate
   - Fixed whitespace handling bug in decoder
   - Ensured robust error handling
   - Built and prepared PyPI package

3. **TypeScript Implementation**:
   - Completed TypeScript port with feature parity to Python
   - Implemented encoder, decoder, and simple API
   - Migrated testing from Jest to Vitest
   - Created comprehensive test suite with proper assertions
   - Added type safety with proper type declarations
   - Fixed linting errors and added type assertions
   - Built and prepared NPM package
   - Created detailed usage examples

4. **GitHub Structure**:
   - Established complete repository structure
   - Created core documentation and configuration files
   - Set up CI workflows for testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Generate TypeDoc API documentation for TypeScript implementation
   - Add examples demonstrating integration with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
   - Document common error handling patterns

2. **Package Publication**:
   - Publish NPM package to npm registry
   - Publish PyPI package to Python Package Index
   - Create release tags in GitHub repository

3. **Performance Measurement**:
   - Create benchmarking scripts for Python and TypeScript implementations
   - Measure encoding/decoding performance vs. JSON
   - Document token efficiency metrics with several example payloads

### Medium-Term Tasks

1. **C# Implementation**:
   - Develop core C# implementation with the same patterns
   - Create NuGet package
   - Add .NET-specific integration examples

2. **Integration Guides**:
   - Create detailed integration guides for popular LLM frameworks
   - Add examples for function calling patterns
   - Provide templates for common LLM workflows

3. **Version 1.3 Planning**:
   - Define scope for LSF v1.3
   - Prioritize performance optimizations
   - Consider adding schema validation capabilities

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **LSF Schema Support**:
   - Evaluating methods for optional schema validation
   - Considering trade-offs between complexity and features

2. **Custom Type Extensions**:
   - Planning support for user-defined type extensions
   - Need to maintain backward compatibility

3. **Error Recovery Strategy**:
   - Current approach has proven effective in testing
   - Considering more advanced recovery techniques for 1.3

4. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - NPM, PyPI, and NuGet packages will be the primary distribution methods
   - GitHub packages as a secondary distribution option

## Current Blockers

No critical blockers at present. The project has made significant progress with both core implementations now complete, tested, and built for distribution. The next phase will focus on package publication, documentation, and beginning the C# implementation.

This active context represents the current state of the LSF project, highlighting the completed work on both Python and TypeScript implementations, and the future focus on documentation, benchmarking, and expansion to C#.
