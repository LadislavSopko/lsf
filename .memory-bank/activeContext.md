# Active Context - Current Development State

## Current Focus

Transitioning from "working prototype" to "production-ready library" across C#, TypeScript, and Python implementations.

## Recent Achievements

1. **Completed Core Implementations** (Phase 0-3)
   - C# reference implementation with 82 tests
   - TypeScript implementation with 70 tests (fixed multi-object bug)
   - Python implementation with 58 tests
   - Total: 210 passing tests

2. **Documentation Created**
   - README.md with clear value prop
   - CONTRIBUTING.md for contributors
   - LSF v3.0 specification finalized

3. **Development Workflow Established**
   - PLAN/ACT mode collaboration
   - Memory Bank documentation system
   - CODE→TEST→FIX methodology

## Active Decisions

1. **Error Handling Priority** - Identified critical gap: almost no error handling exists
2. **Go Implementation Next** - After basic error handling, Go is priority for cloud/microservices
3. **MVP Production Features** - Focus on essential safety/reliability over advanced features

## Current Blockers

None - ready to implement error handling

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Implement comprehensive error handling (Phase 4)
2. Create Go implementation 
3. Set up CI/CD and package publishing

## Recent Insights

- Current implementations silently fail on malformed input (major production risk)
- Error handling is the difference between demo and production quality
- Need consistent error behavior across all language implementations
