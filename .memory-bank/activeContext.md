# LSF Active Context

## Current Focus
We are planning the implementation of a new LSF 3.0 parser based on the updated specification. This is a significant simplification from the LSF 2.0 design, with fewer tokens and a more streamlined approach.

### Key Changes from LSF v2.0 to v3.0
1. Reduced from four structural tokens in v2.0 to just three in v3.0: `$o~`, `$f~`, `$v~` (plus optional `$t~` for types)
2. Removed explicit array tokens (`$a~`), replaced with multiple `$v~` tokens for the same field
3. Simplified structure with only object, field, and value nodes
4. Adopted a strict two-pass parsing strategy: token scanning followed by DOM building

## Recent Decisions
1. **Parser Architecture**: Designed a two-pass parser with separate token scanning and DOM building phases
2. **Performance Focus**: Prioritized speed optimization through pre-allocation, TypedArrays, and zero-copy strategies
3. **Visitor Pattern**: Committed to using the visitor pattern for JSON conversion and other output formats
4. **Array Simplification**: Arrays now represented by multiple values rather than a separate token type

## Current Tasks
1. Planning the core token scanner implementation
2. Designing the DOM builder for efficient traversal
3. Planning the DOM navigator for zero-copy access
4. Designing the visitor pattern for LSF-to-JSON conversion
5. Setting up tests for the new LSF 3.0 parser

## Technical Challenges
1. **Memory Efficiency**: Ensuring the parser uses minimal memory while maintaining performance
2. **Two-Pass Performance**: Optimizing both the token scanning and DOM building passes
3. **Implicit Arrays**: Handling multiple values as arrays without explicit array tokens
4. **Type Safety**: Maintaining type hint support in the new format

## Next Steps
1. Implement the token scanner for efficient token identification
2. Create the DOM builder to process token stream
3. Develop DOM navigator with zero-copy principles
4. Build LSF-to-JSON visitor implementation
5. Set up test suite with basic test cases
6. Benchmark against previous parsers

## Open Questions
1. What are the optimal performance boundaries for token scanning?
2. How can we optimize memory usage with TypedArrays?
3. What's the most efficient way to handle string decoding?

## Current Work Focus

The LSF project is now focused on the implementation of LSF 3.0:

1. **LSF 3.0 Specification**:
   - Created a significantly simplified specification with only three core tokens
   - Designed for even better LLM compatibility
   - Simplified array handling with a semantic approach (multiple values = array)

2. **Parser Implementation Plan**:
   - Completed comprehensive implementation plan (ver2-parser-plan.md)
   - Defined two-pass architecture with token scanner and DOM builder
   - Outlined visitor pattern approach for JSON conversion
   - Established aggressive performance targets (>10M tokens/second)

3. **Next Phase Implementation**:
   - Preparing to implement token scanner
   - Will follow with DOM builder, navigator, and visitor components
   - Focus on performance optimization throughout

## Recent Changes

1. **LSF 3.0 Specification**:
   - Created complete specification document
   - Simplified token structure from v2.0
   - Redesigned with "fewer tokens = fewer mistakes" philosophy
   - Added examples and prompt templates for the new format

2. **Implementation Plan Update**:
   - Updated parser implementation plan from v2.0 to v3.0
   - Redesigned architecture for the simplified token structure
   - Enhanced focus on performance optimization
   - Established clear development phases

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Implementation Start**:
   - Begin implementation of token scanner
   - Create DOM builder based on the implementation plan
   - Develop DOM navigator and JSON visitor

2. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Set up test suite for LSF 3.0 parser
   - Create test cases covering all specification features
   - Implement performance benchmarks

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document the LSF 3.0 parser architecture
   - Create usage examples for the new API
   - Update integration guides

### Medium-Term Tasks

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize token scanning with SIMD where available
   - Refine memory usage patterns
   - Implement benchmarking suite

2. **Language Implementations**:
   - Port the implementation to Python after TypeScript version
   - Ensure consistent API across languages

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Parsing Strategy**:
   - Committed to a strict two-pass approach for maximum performance
   - First pass identifies all tokens
   - Second pass builds the DOM structure

2. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Using TypedArrays for numeric data
   - Pre-allocating arrays based on input size
   - Implementing efficient growth strategies

3. **Visitor Pattern**:
   - Using visitor pattern for output generation
   - Separating DOM structure from JSON conversion
   - Allowing for multiple output formats

## Current Blockers

No critical blockers at present. The project has a clear implementation plan for LSF 3.0 and is ready to begin coding the key components: token scanner, DOM builder, navigator, and JSON visitor.

This active context represents the current state of the LSF project, highlighting the shift to LSF 3.0 with its simplified token structure and the implementation plan that has been developed.
