# Active Context - Current Development State

## Current Focus

Repository reorganization to make the project production-ready with self-contained language implementations.

## Recent Achievements

1. **Phase 6: LLM Integration** (Completed)
   - Added GetLLMPrompt/getLLMPrompt/get_llm_prompt to all implementations
   - Created prompt generation system from single source (prompt-gen)
   - Built comprehensive LLM integration tests for all languages
   - All implementations successfully work with Claude API
   - Tests handle complex cases: quotes, unicode, multi-line content

2. **Documentation & Workflow**
   - Created comprehensive LLM integration examples
   - Added .env support for all implementations
   - Documented test cases and usage patterns
   - All implementations use consistent prompt generation

## Active Decisions

1. **Repository Structure** - Each language should be self-contained
2. **No Mixed Dependencies** - Only prompt-gen is shared between languages
3. **Integration Tests** - Keep with their respective language implementations
4. **Documentation** - Each language gets comprehensive README

## Current State - Phase 9: Repository Reorganization

### Issues Identified:
- Tests scattered across directories
- `examples/llm-integration/` outside implementations
- Python structure non-standard (missing src/, __main__.py)
- Documentation fragmented across multiple READMEs

### Reorganization Plan:
- Move all integration tests into language-specific directories
- Remove examples directory (documentation serves as examples)
- Standardize Python package structure
- Create comprehensive README for each language
- Keep implementations independent and maintainable

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Reorganize JavaScript: Move llm-integration tests to javascript/tests/integration/
2. Reorganize C#: Rename TestPrompts to Integration project
3. Reorganize Python: Create src/lsf structure, add CLI support
4. Update all READMEs with comprehensive guides
5. Clean up redundant files and directories

## Recent Insights

- Self-contained implementations are more maintainable
- Integration tests belong with their language implementation
- Documentation should include runnable examples, not separate example files
- Each language should follow its ecosystem's conventions
