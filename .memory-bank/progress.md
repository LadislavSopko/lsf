## Current Status

LSF is at version 1.2, with a fully defined specification and complete implementations in Python and TypeScript. Both implementations have comprehensive test suites with 100% pass rates. The Python and TypeScript packages have been built and prepared for publication. 

Comprehensive benchmarking tools have been built for both JavaScript and Python implementations, measuring performance, token efficiency, and memory usage. The benchmarks show that LSF is about 30-50% more token-efficient than pretty-printed JSON for complex data. The benchmarks also reveal that the default LSF decoder is 10-77x slower than JSON.parse(), which has led to the development of optimized decoder implementations in Python that improve performance by 1.3-1.4x.

### Milestones Completed

- ✅ Core specification v1.2
- ✅ Basic repository structure
- ✅ Core Python implementation with tests
- ✅ Core TypeScript implementation with tests
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation
- ✅ Python package preparation
- ✅ TypeScript package preparation
- ✅ Performance benchmarking tools for both languages
- ✅ Token efficiency analysis for both languages
- ✅ Optimized decoder implementations in Python

### Milestones In Progress

- ⚠️ Documentation expansion
- ⚠️ Package publications
- ⚠️ Optimized decoder integration

## Known Issues

### General

- ⚠️ Limited usage examples

### Python Implementation

- ⚠️ Binary data handling edge cases need more documentation
- ⚠️ No published PyPI package yet
- ⚠️ Decoder performance significantly slower than JSON
- ⚠️ Data consistency check fails for complex objects in benchmarks

### TypeScript Implementation

- ⚠️ Browser compatibility needs more testing
- ⚠️ No published NPM package yet
- ⚠️ Decoder performance slower than JSON

### Benchmarking

- ⚠️ Token estimation is approximate (uses character count / 4)
- ⚠️ No integration with actual tokenizers yet
- ⚠️ Data consistency check fails for complex objects (due to object reference handling)

## Next Release Target

Version 1.2 implementations are functionally complete, and the next steps involve:

1. 🚀 Package publication on PyPI and NPM
2. 🚀 Documentation enhancements 
3. 🚀 Integration of optimized decoders into core packages
4. 🚀 Planning for v1.3 which will focus on:
   - Extended type system
   - Performance optimizations
   - C# implementation
   - Integration guides for popular LLM frameworks
