# LSF Implementation Progress

## What's Complete
- LSF 3.0 Specification document creation
- Implementation plan for LSF 3.0 parser (ver2-parser-plan.md)
- Design of two-pass architecture with token scanner and DOM builder
- Visitor pattern design for JSON conversion
- **Phase 1: TokenScanner implementation (Pass 1)**
- **Phase 2: DOMBuilder implementation (Pass 2)**
  - Uses Token-Data strategy with implicit node creation
  - Refactored to use per-node `children` arrays

## What's Working
- Existing infrastructure (package.json, dependencies, build tools)
- Testing setup with Vitest framework
- Bundling strategy with tsup
- Core TokenScanner logic (passes tests)
- Core DOMBuilder logic (passes tests)

## In Progress
- Overall architecture refinement for LSF 3.0
- **Phase 3 Planning**: DOM Navigator and Visitor Pattern implementation planning

## Next To Build
1. **Phase 3a: DOMNavigator implementation** (for zero-copy traversal)
2. **Phase 3b: Visitor pattern implementation** (LSFToJSONVisitor first)
3. Comprehensive test suite enhancements for all components
4. Type hint integration testing (beyond basic checks)

## Known Issues
- None critical related to implemented components.

## Timeline Status
- **Phase 1 (Token scanner implementation): Complete**
- **Phase 2 (DOM builder implementation): Complete**
- **Phase 3 (DOM navigator and visitor implementation): Ready to start**
- Phase 4 (Performance optimization and benchmarking): Not started
- Phase 5 (Documentation and release): Not started
