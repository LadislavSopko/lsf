# LSF Implementation Progress

## What's Complete
- LSF 3.0 Specification document creation
- Implementation plan for LSF 3.0 parser (updating from ver2-parser-plan.md)
- Design of two-pass architecture with token scanner and DOM builder
- Visitor pattern design for JSON conversion

## What's Working
- Existing infrastructure (package.json, dependencies, build tools)
- Testing setup with Vitest framework
- Bundling strategy with tsup

## In Progress
- Token scanner implementation planning
- DOM builder design
- Overall architecture refinement for LSF 3.0

## Next To Build
1. Core token scanner implementation for LSF 3.0
2. DOM builder processing identified tokens
3. DOM navigator for zero-copy traversal
4. Visitor pattern implementation for JSON conversion
5. Type hint handling
6. Test suite for LSF 3.0 parser

## Known Issues
None at present - the simplification in LSF 3.0 should address many previous challenges:
- Reduced token set (3 core tokens vs 4 in v2.0)
- Simplified array handling (multiple values = array)
- Clear parsing strategy with two distinct passes

## Timeline Status
- Phase 1 (Token scanner implementation): Ready to start
- Phase 2 (DOM builder implementation): Planning stage
- Phase 3 (DOM navigator and visitor implementation): Planning stage
- Phase 4 (Performance optimization and benchmarking): Not started
- Phase 5 (Documentation and release): Not started
