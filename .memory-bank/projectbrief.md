# LSF Project Brief

## Project Definition
LSF (LLM-Safe Format) is a structured, flat serialization format designed specifically for maximum reliability and minimal error when used with large language models (LLMs). The format avoids common pitfalls found in formats like JSON or XML (such as mismatched brackets, quotes, or indentation) and uses fixed-length, extremely rare separators to maintain structure and parseability.

## Core Requirements

1. **Error Tolerance**: Format must be resilient to small hallucinations or typos that typically break JSON or XML
2. **Simplicity**: Parsing logic should be straightforward with minimal complexity
3. **Deterministic Structure**: Flat, non-nested format that's easy for LLMs to understand and generate
4. **Cross-Language Support**: Implementation in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C# planned)
5. **LLM-Optimized**: Specifically designed for AI model generation rather than human readability
6. **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead in terms of characters or tokens
7. **Interoperability**: Easy conversion to/from more common formats like JSON

## Target Audience
- Developers building agent systems and LLM-based applications
- ML engineers working with structured data generation
- Anyone needing reliable structured output from LLMs

## Success Metrics
- **Reliability**: >95% success rate in correct format generation by LLMs (vs ~82% for JSON)
- **Efficiency**: 20%+ reduction in token usage compared to equivalent JSON
- **Performance**: 50%+ faster parsing than equivalent JSON
- **Adoption**: Implementation in 3+ programming languages

## Out of Scope
- **Human Readability**: LSF intentionally prioritizes machine parsing over human readability
- **Schema Validation**: LSF focuses on format consistency, not schema enforcement
- **Complex Nesting**: LSF avoids deeply nested structures by design
- **Binary Efficiency**: LSF prioritizes text-based representation over binary size optimization

## Milestones
1. **v1.0**: Core specification with basic tokens and parsing
2. **v1.1**: Multi-language implementations (Python, JavaScript)
3. **v1.2**: Type system, error recovery, transaction support (Current)
4. **v1.3**: Performance optimizations and wider language support

## Stakeholders
- Developers integrating with LLMs
- Agent framework maintainers
- LLM application builders

The LSF project aims to solve a critical problem in LLM integration: reliable structured data generation. This format bridges the gap between human-readable formats (which LLMs struggle with) and machine-optimized formats (which maintain consistency even with small errors).
