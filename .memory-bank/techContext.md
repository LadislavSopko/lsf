## Development Setup

### Python Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to `implementations/python`
3. Install development dependencies with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
4. Run tests with `pytest`

### TypeScript Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to `implementations/javascript`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Build the project with `npm run build`
5. Run tests with `npm test`

## Technical Constraints

1. **Zero Dependencies**: Core LSF implementations should have zero runtime dependencies
2. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must be backward compatible with v1.0+
3. **Performance**: Keep encoding/decoding reasonably efficient
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery is a primary design goal

## Dependencies

  - pytest
  - mypy
  - black
  - isort
  - build
  - twine

### TypeScript Implementation

- **Development Dependencies**:
  - typescript
  - vitest
  - eslint
  - prettier
  - tsup
  - @types/node

## Architecture

LSF follows a modular architecture with similar patterns across languages:

1. **Core Classes**:
   - **Encoder**: Handles serialization of objects to LSF format
   - **Decoder**: Handles deserialization of LSF strings to objects
   - **Simple API**: Provides convenience methods for common operations

2. **Conversion Utilities**:
   - **LSF to JSON**: Converts LSF strings to JSON for debugging
   - **JSON to LSF**: Converts JSON strings to LSF

3. **Type System**:
   - Basic types: String, Number, Boolean, Null
   - Extended types: Int, Float, Binary, etc.
   - Type hints for safety and performance

## Benchmarking Architecture

LSF includes comprehensive benchmarking tools to evaluate performance and efficiency:

1. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Measures encoding and decoding speed
   - Compares with JSON operations
   - Tests various data sizes and complexity levels
   - Profiles memory usage
   - Identifies performance bottlenecks

2. **Token Efficiency Analysis**:
   - Measures token counts with estimated tokenization
   - Compares LSF vs JSON in various scenarios
   - Analyzes efficiency for different data structures
   - Considers both compact and pretty-printed formats

3. **Optimized Decoders in Python**:
   - **FastLSFDecoder**: Uses pre-compiled regex patterns and lookup tables
   - **NonRegexDecoder**: Avoids regular expressions for direct string operations
   - **StreamingDecoder**: Single-pass approach with minimal object creation
   - Factory pattern for selecting optimization strategy

## Implementation Notes

### Python Implementation

The Python implementation serves as the reference implementation. It provides:

1. **LSFEncoder**: Core class for encoding Python objects to LSF strings
2. **LSFDecoder**: Core class for decoding LSF strings back to Python objects
3. **Simple API** (`to_lsf`, `from_lsf`): Convenience functions for common operations
4. **Conversion utilities**: Tools for debugging and visualization
5. **Benchmarking tools**: Performance and token efficiency analysis
6. **Optimized decoders**: Alternative implementations for better performance

The Python implementation focuses on clarity and correctness, with all core code well-documented and type-hinted. The current decoder uses regex-based parsing, which benchmarks have shown to be slower than JSON.parse() by 10-77x depending on data complexity. Optimized decoders improve performance by 1.3-1.4x through techniques like pre-compiled regex, direct string operations, and streaming parsing.

### TypeScript Implementation

The TypeScript implementation provides:

1. **LSFEncoder**: Core class for encoding JavaScript objects to LSF strings
2. **LSFDecoder**: Core class for decoding LSF strings back to JavaScript objects
3. **Simple API** (`LSFSimple`): Class with convenience methods
4. **Conversion utilities**: Tools for debugging
5. **Bundling options**: Single-file distributions for different environments

The TypeScript implementation is fully typed and designed to work in both Node.js and browser environments.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Encoder Performance**:
   - LSF encoder performance is comparable to JSON.stringify in most cases
   - Complex nested structures may be slightly slower with LSF

2. **Decoder Performance**:
   - LSF decoding is significantly slower than JSON.parse (10-77x)
   - Performance gap increases with data complexity
   - Regex-based parsing is the main bottleneck
   - Optimized decoders provide ~1.4x improvement but still lag behind JSON

3. **Token Efficiency**:
   - LSF is 30-50% more token-efficient than pretty-printed JSON
   - For nested and repetitive structures, efficiency gain can be up to 83%
   - LSF is slightly less efficient than compact JSON for simple data
   - Token efficiency advantage increases with data complexity

4. **Memory Usage**:
   - LSF generally uses more memory during parsing than JSON
   - Memory profiling shows LSF decoder uses 1.4-2x more memory than JSON.parse
