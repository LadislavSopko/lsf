# LSF Development Plan - Production Ready

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to transform LSF into a production-ready, industrial-strength serialization format with robust implementations across multiple languages.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE
For EVERY task below, follow this loop:
1. **CODE** - Write/modify code
2. **TEST** - Run tests, verify behavior
3. **FIX** - Fix any issues found
4. **REPEAT** - Continue until all tests pass

⚠️ **STOP RULE**: If after 3-4 iterations a problem isn't resolved, STOP and ask for help. No workarounds, no skipping tests. The library must work perfectly.

## Phase 0: Critical TypeScript Fix (URGENT)
### Fix Missing Public API
- [x] Open `implementations/javascript/src/index.ts` (currently empty!)
- [x] Export public API matching C# functionality:
  - [x] `parseLSFToDom(input: string | Uint8Array)`
  - [x] `parseLSFToJSON(input: string | Uint8Array)`
  - [x] `encodeLSFToString(data: object, objectName?: string)`
  - [x] `encodeLSFToArray(data: object, objectName?: string)`
- [x] Test that npm package exports work correctly
- [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until working

**COMPLETED** ✅ - index.ts now exports full public API. Build succeeds, tests pass.
**NOTE**: Found encoder bug (999.99 gets `$t~n` instead of `$t~f`) - will fix in Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Fix C# Implementation First
### Add Missing Tests to C#
- [x] Add multi-object parsing tests to `DOMBuilderTests.cs`
  - [x] Test: Sequential objects `$o~Obj1$f~field$v~value$o~Obj2$f~field$v~value`
  - [x] Test: Multiple anonymous objects
  - [x] Test: Mixed named and anonymous objects
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until passing
- [x] Add multi-object tests to `LSFToJSONVisitorTests.cs`
  - [x] Test: JSON output for multiple objects
  - [x] Test: Correct array structure for multiple objects
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until passing
- [x] Add edge case tests
  - [x] Test: Unicode/UTF-8 characters in values
  - [x] Test: Very long field names and values
  - [x] Test: Malformed tokens (partial tokens)
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until passing
- [x] Verify all existing tests still pass
- [x] Run full test suite 3 times to ensure stability

### Fix Multi-Object Bug in C# (if found)
- [x] Run new multi-object tests
- [x] If failing: Debug and fix the visitor/navigator
- [x] Ensure fix doesn't break existing functionality
- [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until all tests green

**RESULT**: No bugs found! C# implementation already handles multi-object parsing correctly. All 82 tests pass.

### Extract C# Tests as Reference
- [x] Document all test cases from C# implementation
- [x] Create test extraction script or manual process
- [x] Generate JSON test format from C# tests
- [x] Validate extracted tests match original behavior

**COMPLETED** ✅ - Tests successfully replicated across all implementations

## Phase 2: Fix TypeScript Implementation
### Run C# Reference Tests on TypeScript
- [x] Port multi-object tests to TypeScript
- [x] Run all tests - identify failures
- [x] Fix multi-object parsing bug
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop
  - [x] If stuck after 3-4 iterations: STOP, ask for help
- [x] Ensure all C# test scenarios pass in TypeScript
- [x] Run full test suite 3 times

**COMPLETED** ✅ - Fixed two bugs:
1. **Encoder bug**: Float values now correctly get `$t~f` instead of `$t~n`
2. **Multi-object bug**: Visitor now processes all root objects, returns array for multiple objects
All 70 tests pass consistently.

## Phase 3: Replicate C# Tests to Other Languages
### Use C# as the Reference Implementation
- [x] Document all C# test cases and expected behaviors
- [x] Create a checklist of all C# tests that must be replicated

### TypeScript Test Replication
- [x] Manually port each C# test to TypeScript/Vitest
  - [x] Keep the same test names and structure
  - [x] Same input data, same expected outputs
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop for each test
- [x] Ensure TypeScript matches C# behavior exactly
- [x] No JSON files, no complex test infrastructure
- [x] Just good old-fashioned test copying

### Python Test Replication
- [x] Manually port each C# test to Python/pytest
  - [x] Keep the same test names and structure
  - [x] Same input data, same expected outputs
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop for each test
- [x] Ensure Python matches C# behavior exactly

### Benefits of This Approach
- [x] No complex infrastructure to maintain
- [x] Each language uses its native testing idioms
- [x] Easy to debug in VS Code
- [x] Clear reference implementation (C#)
- [x] Simple to understand and extend

**COMPLETED** ✅ - All implementations now have consistent test coverage:
- C#: 82 tests
- TypeScript: 70 tests  
- Python: 58 tests
Total: 210 tests passing

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

### Critical Error Handling (ALL Languages)

#### Error Class Hierarchy
- [ ] Base error class: `LSFError`
- [ ] Parse errors: `LSFParseError` (includes position info)
- [ ] Validation errors: `LSFValidationError`
- [ ] Encoding errors: `LSFEncodingError`

#### Specific Error Cases to Handle
1. **Malformed Tokens**
   - [ ] Missing value after `$v~`: "Unexpected end of input after $v~ at position X"
   - [ ] Partial token at EOF: "Unexpected EOF while reading token at position X"
   - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop

2. **Invalid Token Sequences**
   - [ ] Double `$o~`: "Unexpected $o~ at position X, expected $f~"
   - [ ] `$t~` without preceding `$v~`: "Type hint without value at position X"
   - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop

3. **Validation Errors**
   - [ ] Empty field names: "Field name cannot be empty at position X"
   - [ ] Invalid type hints: "Unknown type 'x' at position X. Valid: n,f,b,d,s"
   - [ ] Maximum size limit (10MB default): "Input exceeds maximum size"
   - [ ] Maximum field/value length (configurable)
   - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop

4. **Data Integrity**
   - [ ] Token inside value data: Document behavior or provide escape mechanism
   - [ ] Invalid UTF-8 sequences: "Invalid UTF-8 at byte position X"
   - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop

5. **Parsing Modes**
   - [ ] Strict mode: Fail on any error
   - [ ] Lenient mode: Best-effort parsing with warnings
   - [ ] Configurable via options parameter

### C# Specific Implementation
- [ ] Replace all `return null` with proper exceptions
- [ ] Add `LSFParserOptions` class for configuration
- [ ] Implement ILogger interface support

- [ ] Include source position in all errors
- [ ] Add `ParserOptions` interface
- [ ] Improve TypeScript types (strict mode)
- [ ] Add JSDoc for all exports
- [ ] Create separate entry points for Node/Browser

### Python Specific Implementation
- [ ] Add custom exception classes
- [ ] Include position tracking in parser
- [ ] Add `ParserOptions` dataclass
- [ ] Proper error messages with positions

### Performance & Security
- [ ] Input size validation (before parsing)
- [ ] Memory usage limits
- [ ] Benchmark error handling overhead
- [ ] Document security considerations

## Phase 5: New Language Implementations

### Python Implementation
- [x] Create package structure following Python conventions
- [x] Implement TokenScanner
