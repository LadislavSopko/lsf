# LSF Development Plan - Production Ready

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to transform LSF into a production-ready, industrial-strength serialization format with robust implementations across multiple languages.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE
For EVERY task below, follow this loop:
1. **CODE** - Write/modify code
2. **TEST** - Run tests, verify behavior
3. **FIX** - Fix any issues found
4. **REPEAT** - Continue until all tests pass

⚠️ **STOP RULE**: If after 3-4 iterations a problem isn't resolved, STOP and ask for help. No workarounds, no skipping tests. The library must work perfectly.

## Phase 0: Critical TypeScript Fix (URGENT)
### Fix Missing Public API
- [x] Open `implementations/javascript/src/index.ts` (currently empty!)
- [x] Export public API matching C# functionality:
  - [x] `parseLSFToDom(input: string | Uint8Array)`
  - [x] `parseLSFToJSON(input: string | Uint8Array)`
  - [x] `encodeLSFToString(data: object, objectName?: string)`
  - [x] `encodeLSFToArray(data: object, objectName?: string)`
- [x] Test that npm package exports work correctly
- [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until working

**COMPLETED** ✅ - index.ts now exports full public API. Build succeeds, tests pass.
**NOTE**: Found encoder bug (999.99 gets `$t~n` instead of `$t~f`) - will fix in Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Fix C# Implementation First
### Add Missing Tests to C#
- [x] Add multi-object parsing tests to `DOMBuilderTests.cs`
  - [x] Test: Sequential objects `$o~Obj1$f~field$v~value$o~Obj2$f~field$v~value`
  - [x] Test: Multiple anonymous objects
  - [x] Test: Mixed named and anonymous objects
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until passing
- [x] Add multi-object tests to `LSFToJSONVisitorTests.cs`
  - [x] Test: JSON output for multiple objects
  - [x] Test: Correct array structure for multiple objects
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until passing
- [x] Add edge case tests
  - [x] Test: Unicode/UTF-8 characters in values
  - [x] Test: Very long field names and values
  - [x] Test: Malformed tokens (partial tokens)
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until passing
- [x] Verify all existing tests still pass
- [x] Run full test suite 3 times to ensure stability

### Fix Multi-Object Bug in C# (if found)
- [x] Run new multi-object tests
- [x] If failing: Debug and fix the visitor/navigator
- [x] Ensure fix doesn't break existing functionality
- [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop until all tests green

**RESULT**: No bugs found! C# implementation already handles multi-object parsing correctly. All 82 tests pass.

### Extract C# Tests as Reference
- [ ] Document all test cases from C# implementation
- [ ] Create test extraction script or manual process
- [ ] Generate JSON test format from C# tests
- [ ] Validate extracted tests match original behavior

## Phase 2: Fix TypeScript Implementation
### Run C# Reference Tests on TypeScript
- [x] Port multi-object tests to TypeScript
- [x] Run all tests - identify failures
- [x] Fix multi-object parsing bug
  - [x] CODE → TEST → FIX loop
  - [x] If stuck after 3-4 iterations: STOP, ask for help
- [x] Ensure all C# test scenarios pass in TypeScript
- [x] Run full test suite 3 times

**COMPLETED** ✅ - Fixed two bugs:
1. **Encoder bug**: Float values now correctly get `$t~f` instead of `$t~n`
2. **Multi-object bug**: Visitor now processes all root objects, returns array for multiple objects
All 70 tests pass consistently.

## Phase 3: Replicate C# Tests to Other Languages
### Use C# as the Reference Implementation
- [ ] Document all C# test cases and expected behaviors
- [ ] Create a checklist of all C# tests that must be replicated

### TypeScript Test Replication
- [ ] Manually port each C# test to TypeScript/Vitest
  - [ ] Keep the same test names and structure
  - [ ] Same input data, same expected outputs
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop for each test
- [ ] Ensure TypeScript matches C# behavior exactly
- [ ] No JSON files, no complex test infrastructure
- [ ] Just good old-fashioned test copying

### Python Test Replication (future)
- [ ] Manually port each C# test to Python/pytest
  - [ ] Keep the same test names and structure
  - [ ] Same input data, same expected outputs
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop for each test
- [ ] Ensure Python matches C# behavior exactly

### Benefits of This Approach
- [ ] No complex infrastructure to maintain
- [ ] Each language uses its native testing idioms
- [ ] Easy to debug in VS Code
- [ ] Clear reference implementation (C#)
- [ ] Simple to understand and extend

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

### C# Implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with specific exception types
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop
- [ ] Add logging support (optional ILogger interface)
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop
- [ ] Memory optimization for large documents
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop with benchmarks
- [ ] Add streaming API for huge files
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop
- [ ] Thread safety documentation/guarantees
- [ ] NuGet package configuration
- [ ] XML documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] Add .NET 6.0+ target for better performance
  - [ ] Verify no breaking changes

### TypeScript Implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with error codes
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop
- [ ] Add debug/trace logging support
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large documents
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop with benchmarks
- [ ] Add streaming API
  - [ ] CODE → TEST → FIX loop
- [ ] Improve TypeScript types (strict mode)

- [ ] Create separate entry points for Node/Browser
- [ ] Add source maps to bundle

### Both Implementations
- [ ] Consistent API design across languages
- [ ] Consistent error messages
- [ ] Performance benchmarks vs JSON
- [ ] Security considerations (max input size, etc.)
- [ ] Run ALL tests after EACH change

## Phase 5: New Language Implementations

### Python Implementation
- [x] Create package structure following Python conventions
- [x] Implement TokenScanner

  - [ ] Real-world usage examples shared

## Development Principles
1. **Perfect Working Library** - No shortcuts, no workarounds
2. **Test-Driven** - Write tests first, then code
3. **Stop When Stuck** - After 3-4 iterations without progress, ask for help
4. **C# as Reference** - C# implementation defines expected behavior
5. **Incremental Progress** - Complete each phase fully before moving on

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 3-4 days (C# fixes and comprehensive tests)
- Phase 2: 2-3 days (TypeScript fixes)
- Phase 3: 3-4 days (Unified test suite)
- Phase 4: 1-2 weeks (Production readiness)
- Phase 5: 2-3 weeks (New languages)
- Phase 6-7: 1-2 weeks (Documentation and CI/CD)
- Phase 8: Ongoing

Total: ~6-8 weeks for production-ready status

## Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1: Add multi-object tests to C#
2. Follow CODE → TEST → FIX loop strictly
3. Document any issues that take more than 3 iterations
